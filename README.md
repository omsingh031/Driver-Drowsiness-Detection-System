## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** using **Computer Vision**.
It monitors the driver's eye movements in real-time and detects fatigue using the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**.
If drowsiness is detected, an **alarm is triggered** to alert the driver and prevent accidents.

---

## 🎯 Applications

- 🚗 Long-distance drivers
- 🚛 Truck and transport monitoring
- 🚌 Public transport safety
- 🏍️ Riders prone to fatigue

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Real-time face detection
- Facial landmark detection (eyes tracking)
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation
- Drowsiness detection based on blink duration
- Alarm alert system

---

## 🛠️ Code Requirements

- Python 3.x (2.7+ supported)
- Webcam

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils dlib scipy playsound
```

Libraries used:

```python
import cv2
import imutils
import dlib
import scipy
import playsound
import queue
import time
import sys
```

## 📝 Description

This system uses OpenCV and Dlib to detect driver drowsiness in real-time. It captures video from a webcam, detects facial landmarks, extracts eye regions, and calculates EAR. If the eyes remain closed beyond a threshold duration, the system identifies drowsiness and triggers an alert.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm

### 1️⃣ Face Detection

- Uses Dlib's HOG + Linear SVM based face detector

### 2️⃣ Facial Landmark Detection

- Detects 68 facial landmarks
- Extracts eye coordinates

### 3️⃣ Eye Detection

### 4️⃣ Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)

- Determines whether eyes are open or closed
- Threshold ≈ 0.3

### 5️⃣ Drowsiness Logic

- Normal blink: 200–300 ms
- Drowsy blink: 800–900 ms
- If EAR < threshold for long → Drowsiness Detected

---

## ▶️ Execution

Run the following command:

```bash
python blinkDetect.py
```

## 📊 Results

- Detects eye closure in real-time
- Differentiates normal vs drowsy blinking
- Triggers alert instantly

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Sensitive to lighting conditions
- Requires proper camera angle
- Accuracy depends on hardware
